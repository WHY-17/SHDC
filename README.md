SHDC: A Method of Similarity Measurement Using Heat Kernel based on Denoising for Clustering scRNA-seq Data
A Method of Similarity Measurement Using Heat Kernel based on Denoising for Clustering scRNA-seq Data (SHDC) was proposed for single cell clustering. SHDC denoised scRNA-seq datasets to obtain a more stable data structure and only a heat kernel was used to measure similarity between cells.
